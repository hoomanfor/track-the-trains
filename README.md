Check it out: [Track the Trains!](https://hoomanfor.github.io/track-the-trains/)

This application can be used to track train arrivals. Complete the form to add a train. The "Current Train Schedule" will display the next train arrival and countdown the minutes until next train arrival. Train data is persisted using Google Firebase Realtime Database. Don't miss your train! :-D
